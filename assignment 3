Questions for this assignment
You are a DevSecOps engineer and you have been tasked with creating a Jenkinsfile for performing SCA scan on a Java web application using Snyk. The Jenkinsfile should include the following stages:

Checkout: Checkout the source code from a Git repository "https://github.com/your-repo/your-node-app.git".

Build: Build the Java application using the "mvn install" command.

Test: Run unit tests on the Node.js application using the "mvn test" command.

SCA scan: Run SCA scan using Snyk. Credentials are stored in Jenkins credential manager. Use "SNYK_TOKEN" as credentialsId and variable name for passing the credentials to the stage. Make sure that Snyk FAILS the build if security vulnerabilities are identified in third party libraries.
